1. We finish the function of signup and login, and find that if
 users signup several times with the same information, our signup 
function will just accept it without prompt. Also when someone
try to sign up using a name begin with spaces, there is no warning
. However, login system will not accept name with pure spaces.

2. We finish the function that users could login as driver with their 
vehicles' information, and are able to see which rides are confirmed 
or opened. However, if a user doesn't want to be a driver anymore,
he could not eliminate his driver information unless he signup with 
a new user name. Also, once a user is identified as driver, he is not 
allowed to request a ride without logout and login again.

3. We finsih the function that users are able to search for a specific
requirement. However, if user left one of the blank empty or type in
information of a non-exist ride and click search, the webpage will 
breakdown without warning prompt.

4. We find that user could request a ride with time earlier than present.

5. We find that if user A request for a ride that allows sharing, later user
B choose to share with A and click sharing, A will not receive any prompt.  

6. We put the entire project into docker and changed to postgresql in the end, but postgresql kept reporting errors. See we used sqlite3 instead.
